# house
Focusing on CSS properties for this one. Things like positioning stuff and nesting. Main task is to make a house with chimney smoke. 

- HTML: for the most part, i remembered most things. i forgot to add a wrapper at the beginning and realized later how much of a difference it made when i started trying to center everything.
- CSS: refreshened a lot of positioning knowledge. also keyframe animation stuff. the roof triangle was a real doozy. ended up trying two different things. stuck with the first attempt, but left the 2nd attempt commented out for future reference. 
- JS: totally forgot how to iterate through an array. i was really stuck on this idea of needing a temporary variable to allow an item to sit for a bit. i think i was thinking of sorting the array as opposed to just iterating through it. anyway, i found a very simple solution and was able to implement it (and understand what was going on).

Overall, this was a pretty balanced project. I knew in theory what I needed to do for everything and it really just took some quick searches to refreshen my syntax knowledge. I forgot how much of CSS is about trying something, testing it and constantly tweaking until it looks right. As for the JS stuff, I think I'm relying too much on trying to remember fancy ways of doing things (from the past) as opposed to looking at problems as they are in front of me and solving them with my current knowledge. Something to consider going forward. 11/25/18
